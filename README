Simple groovy scripts for creating deployment and pom files for jars of an existing webapp.

I use it mainly for creating pom files for opencms [http://www.opencms.org] which contains a lot of dependencies that can't be found in any repositories. A blogpost about it: http://fhopf.blogspot.com/2010/04/playing-with-groovy.html

The directory to process needs to be passed to the script as a parameter, e.g. groovy org/synyx/maven/GuessDependencies.groovy /path/to/WEB-INF/lib/

These are the steps to create a deployable project:
* Guess dependencies from filenames: groovy org/synyx/maven/GuessDependencies.groovy /path/to/WEB-INF/lib/
* Manually check the created list in /path/to/WEB-INF/lib/dependencies.properties
* Add project information in /path/to/WEB-INF/lib/project.properties
* Create the deployable artifacts: groovy org/synyx/maven/CreateDeployment.groovy /path/to/WEB-INF/lib/

The generated script deploy.sh contains the mvn commands to deploy all artifacts. You can edit it and uncomment any artifacts that already are in your repository or on central.
